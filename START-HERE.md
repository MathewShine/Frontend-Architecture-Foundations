# Frontend Architecture Foundations — Start Here

This repository captures **frontend architecture foundations** built from real-world experience designing and scaling complex, product-driven applications.

It is intended to be read as a **thinking repository**, not a codebase.

## How to read this repository

If you’re new here, start with these sections:

### 1. Principles
The `principles/` folder documents **core architectural principles** that guide frontend system design.

These files focus on:
- Why frontend systems break at scale
- How architectural decisions affect teams and users
- Trade-offs between simplicity, flexibility, and performance

---

### 2. Playbooks
The `playbooks/` folder contains **practical architecture playbooks** for recurring frontend problems.

This includes:
- Folder structure strategies
- State management approaches
- UI vs domain logic separation
- Performance and resilience considerations

Each playbook explains *when* a strategy works and *when it doesn’t*.

---

### 3. Case Studies
The `case-studies/` folder provides **real-world examples** from production systems.

These documents describe:
- Context and constraints
- Architecture decisions taken
- What worked, what failed, and what I would change today

---

### 4. Decision Log
The `decision-log/` folder tracks **important architectural decisions** and the reasoning behind them.

This reflects how frontend architecture evolves over time as products and teams scale.

## What this repository is (and isn’t)

This repository **is**:
- A collection of architecture principles and system-level thinking
- Grounded in real product experience
- Focused on long-term maintainability and user trust

This repository **is not**:
- A framework tutorial
- A UI component library
- A visual design showcase

---

## Why this matters

Frontend architecture directly impacts:
- Product reliability
- Team velocity
- User trust
- Long-term cost

This repository exists to document how thoughtful frontend system design can reduce complexity and improve outcomes for both users and teams.
