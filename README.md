# Frontend-Architecture-Foundations
This repository documents core frontend architecture principles, decisions, and trade-offs involved in building scalable, product-driven web applications.

It is not a collection of UI components or framework tutorials.
Instead, it focuses on how and why frontend systems are designed — especially in domains where correctness, performance, and user trust matter.

The ideas here are shaped by real-world experience building trading platforms, portfolio intelligence tools, and enterprise finance automation systems, where frontend architecture directly impacts usability, risk, and long-term maintainability.
