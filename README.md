Frontend Architecture Foundations
----------------------------------

This repository documents core frontend architecture principles, decisions, and trade-offs involved in building scalable, product-driven web applications.

It is not a collection of UI components or framework tutorials.
Instead, it focuses on how and why frontend systems are designed — especially in domains where correctness, performance, and user trust matter.

The ideas here are shaped by real-world experience building trading platforms, portfolio intelligence tools, and enterprise finance automation systems, where frontend architecture directly impacts usability, risk, and long-term maintainability.

Why this repository exists
--------------------------

Frontend systems tend to degrade over time — not because of React or tools, but because of unclear architectural decisions made early and never revisited.

This repository exists to:

Capture architecture-first thinking for frontend systems

Document principles over patterns

Share lessons learned from production systems

Provide a reference for designing frontend platforms that scale with teams and product complexity

What this repository focuses on
----------------------------------

This repository explores topics such as:

Frontend architecture principles and system boundaries

Separation of concerns between UI, state, and domain logic

Architectural trade-offs in real products

Common frontend anti-patterns that emerge at scale

How UX requirements influence architectural decisions

Where helpful, examples are drawn from financial and decision-critical products, but the principles apply broadly to large frontend applications.

What this repository is NOT
---------------------------------

To set clear expectations, this repository is not:

A React tutorial or component library

A “best practices” checklist without context

A framework comparison blog

A place for visual UI experiments

The emphasis is on thinking, reasoning, and decision-making rather than implementation details.

How to use this repository
------------------------------------

You can read this repository:

Top-down, to understand frontend architecture as a system

Selectively, to explore specific architectural problems

As a reference when designing or reviewing frontend systems

Each section focuses on why a decision exists, not just what was chosen
